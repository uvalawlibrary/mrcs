    "We used a 80-20 train-test split, retaining 20% of the dataset to estimate model performance and using the remaining 80% to select a model. Several candidate models were compared using grid-search cross validation. This process suggested the use of an XGBoost model. However, we encountered issues extracting the best fit parameters from XG Boost and consequently, used Random Forest for the best parameter fit and prediction on the test data. However, the DistilBERT model performed better and was eventually chosen as the model for the project. We include notebooks for the DistilBERT selection and final model run. "
