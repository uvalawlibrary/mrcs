The script includes the chechpoints for the second run of the final model which performed worse than than the first version. The first version, saved as \"Final_bertmodel1\" achieved accuracy: 0.9751 and f1: 0.9368 scores. Instead of reruning the model a 3rd time given the lower performance, we used the first model to run the prediction on the test set. \n",
